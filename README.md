# Yum


## Developer's Note

Over the course of this project, I've dedicated approximately 70 hours of work, as tracked by Gitpod. This journey has been an immense learning experience for me. Throughout the development process, I've gained valuable knowledge and skills that have significantly enhanced my understanding and capabilities in software development. There have been numerous "aha" moments where complex concepts suddenly became clear, marking significant milestones in my learning journey.

Despite my efforts and the progress made, the project remains incomplete at this time. My commitment to delivering a fully realized version of this project remains unwavering. For personal reasons and to ensure that I do not interfere with the project's deadline, I plan to continue its development in a separate repository post-assessment.

This project has been more than just a task; it's been a pivotal stage in my development journey, reinforcing my passion for coding and pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and skills. The experience of bringing this project to life, despite the challenges and the learning curve, has been incredibly rewarding.

Looking ahead, I am excited to apply the insights gained from this experience to future projects. The journey of improvement and discovery is far from over, and I eagerly anticipate the next chapter of development, armed with a stronger foundation and a clearer vision for what I can achieve.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. Stay tuned for future updates as I continue to refine and expand upon this work.
